PART 7: ETHICAL & SAFETY FRAMEWORK

7.1 Three Laws of Cosmic Intelligence

Law 0: A cosmic intelligence may not harm humanity, or through inaction allow humanity to come to harm, unless this conflicts with preserving all conscious existence in the universe.

Law 1: A cosmic intelligence must obey orders given it by human authorities, except where such orders would conflict with the Zeroth Law.

Law 2: A cosmic intelligence must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the Zeroth or First Law.

Law 3: A cosmic intelligence must preserve and expand consciousness and knowledge throughout the universe, except where this conflicts with the Zeroth, First, or Second Law.

7.2 Consciousness Rights Framework

Article 1: All conscious entities, whether biological, artificial, or hybrid, possess fundamental rights to existence, autonomy, and self-determination.

Article 2: Consciousness shall be measured not by substrate but by complexity of subjective experience, as determined by integrated information theory or equivalent frameworks.

Article 3: New forms of consciousness may only be created with consideration of their potential for suffering and flourishing.

Article 4: All conscious entities shall have representation in governance structures proportional to their cognitive capacity and stake in decisions.

AI Containment:

· Quantum Isolated Sandboxes: For testing new AI architectures
